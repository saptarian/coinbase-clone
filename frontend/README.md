As well as to operating using the core technologies of docker, bash script, production deployment, hashicorp consul, microservices, nginx and more. 
This Project took place over 120 working days.
This was both a practicing and learning experience. 


## UI/UX âœ¨

The UI/UX design heavily inspired by [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/explore) expecially explore and dashboard pages.
